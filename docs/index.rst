Welcome to Caustic's documentation!
===================================

The lensing pipeline of the future: GPU-accelerated, automatically-differentiable, highly modular and extensible.

.. note::

    Caustic is in its early development phase. This means the API will change with time. These changes are a good thing, but they can be annoying. Watch the version numbers, when we get to 1.0.0 that will be the first stable release!

Intallation
===========

The easiest way to install is to make a new virtual environment then run::

    pip install caustic

this will install all the required libraries and then install caustic and you are ready to go! You can check out the tutorials afterwards to see some of caustic's capabilities.  If you want to help out with building the caustic code base check out the developer installation instructions instead.
