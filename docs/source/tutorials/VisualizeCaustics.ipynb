    "Here we will demonstrate how to collect caustic lines using caustic! Since caustic (the code) uses autodiff and can get exact derivatives, it is actually very accurate at computing caustics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually a caustic occurs where the magnification of a lens diverges to infinity. A convenient way to measure the magnification in the image plane is by taking the determinant ($det$) of the jacobian of the lens equation ($A$), its reciprocal is the magnification. This means that anywhere that $det(A) = 0$ is a critical line in the image plane (magnification goes to infinity). If we take this line and raytrace it back to the source plane we can see the caustics which define boundaries for lensing phenomena."

    "\n",
    "Before we can see the caustics, we need to find the critical lines. The critical lines are the locus of points in the lens plane (the plane of the mass causing the lensing) at which the magnification of the source becomes theoretically infinite for a point source. In simpler terms, it is where the lensing effect becomes so strong that it can create highly magnified and distorted images of the source. The shape and size of the critical curve depend on the distribution of mass in the lensing object. These lines can be found using the Jacobian of the lensing deflection, specifically $A = \\mathbb{I} - J$. When ${\\rm det}(A) = 0$, that point is on the critical line. Interestingly, $\\frac{1}{{\\rm det}(A)}$ is the magnification, which is why ${\\rm det}(A) = 0$ defines the points of infinite magnification."
