    "# Building your own simulator from scratch: a tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will build a fully-functional gravitational lensing simulator based on LensSource, the prebuilt simulator which comes with `caustics`. We will then demonstrate how you can modify a custom simulator to extend its capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: The `__init__` function\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we begin by creating a new **class** for our simulator. \n",
    "**For those new to object-oriented programming**: a class is like a dictionary, you can store anything in it and retrieve it by name. The syntax is a bit different, instead of doing ``dictionary[\"key\"]`` to get something from it, you would do ``instance.attribute`` to access that value, function, or even another class instance. When you write a ``class`` it is like a template, you need to ``instantiate`` the template (something like ``myinstance = myclass(initial, parameters)``) to get an object that you can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want our simulator to inherit from the **Module** class in `caustics`, which is a basic framework for constructing simulator objects. To create inheritance, we put the parent class as an argument (in parentheses) to the child class. Then, in the `__init__` function, we need a few basic ingredients to create the simulator:\n",
    "1. A lens mass distribution\n",
    "2. A model for the lens light\n",
    "3. A model for the source light\n",
    "4. A model for the telescope PSF\n",
    "5. A value for the pixel scale of the CCD\n",
    "6. The number of pixels in the CCD\n",
    "7. The upsample factor (increases the resolution of the simulator internally to improve accuracy)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also provide a name for the simulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within our `__init__` function, we need to provide instructions to construct the basic structure of the simulator object, which is done by calling the `__init__` function of the `super` class, which in this case is `Module` from `caustics`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within `__init__` we also need to construct the components of our simulator. For components which are constructed once (lens mass model, lens light model, and source light model), we simply need to make them attributes of the current object being constructed (`self`). We do the same for parameters whose value we wish to only set once, such as the coordinate grid, which we generate with the `meshgrid` function of caustics. For parameters which we wish to sample with our MCMC (which are not already parameters of any of the existing components), we need to register them as a `Param` object, which will allow our simulator to find them in the flattened vector of parameters which we will pass to the simulator. In this example, we register the PSF as a `Param` and name it `\"PSF\"`. We also have to tell Param what shape the PSF array will take so that the PSF can be extracted from the flattened tensor (in this example, we allow a variable-sized PSF). For more information on the underlying functionality of `Module`, `Param`, and related parameter handling capabilities in `caustics`, see the underlying **caskade** package and associated documentation: https://caskade.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/BeginnersGuide.html"

    "In the code above, in addition to the `__init__` function, you can see that we have added another function called `run_simulator`. This is the part of our simulator object which will actually perform the simulation (when called). Our simulation has a few basic steps:\n",

    "5. Convolve with the PSF of the telescope\n",
    "\n",
