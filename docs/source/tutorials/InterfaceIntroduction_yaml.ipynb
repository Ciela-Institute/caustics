    "Here we will demo the very basics of lensing with a classic `SIE` lens model. We will see what it takes to make an `SIE` model, lens a background `Sersic` source, and sample the resulting image using a `Simulator`. Caustics simulators can generalize to very complex scenarios, here we will use a built-in simulator which handles a common use case (lensing a background source). To start, we of course need to import some modules. For the minimal example, this is just `matplotlib` a common package used for plotting, `torch` which is a numerical package for GPU/autodiff (much like `numpy`), and `caustics` the reason you are here.\n",

At the top of the graph is the `LensSource` object, you can see in brackets it has a name `sim` which is used as the identifier for it's node in the graph. At the next level is the `z_s` parameter for the redshift of the source. Next are the `SIE` lens, `Sersic` source, and `Sersic` lenslight objects which themselves each hold parameters.
