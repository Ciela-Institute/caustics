In this tutorial we will cover the basics of caustic and how to get going making your own lensing configurations. Caustic is easy to use and very powerful, you will get to see some of that power here, but there will be more notebooks which demo specific use cases."

    "## Simulating an SIE lens\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will demo the very basics of lensing with a classic `SIE` lens model. We will see what it takes to make an `SIE` model, lens a background `Sersic` source, and sample some examples in a simulator. Caustic simulators can generalize to very complex scenarios. In these cases there can be a lot of parameters moving through the simulator, and the order/number of parameters may change depending on what lens or source is being used. To streamline this process, caustic implements a class called `Parametrized` which has some knowledge of the parameters moving through it, this way it can keep track of everything for you. For this to work, you must put the parameters into a `Packed` object which it can recognize, each sub function can then unpack the parameters it needs. Below we will show some examples of what this looks like."
