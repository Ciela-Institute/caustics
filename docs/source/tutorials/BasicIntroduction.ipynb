We will see what it takes to make an `SIE` model, lens a background `Sersic` source, and sample the resulting image using a `Simulator`. Caustics simulators can generalize to very complex scenarios, here we will use a built-in simulator which handles a common use case (lensing a background source). To start, we of course need to import some modules. For the minimal example, this is just `matplotlib` a common package used for plotting, `torch` which is a numerical package for GPU/autodiff (much like `numpy`), and `caustics` the reason you are here.\n",

There are a number of ways to pass these parameters to a Caustics simulator, but the most straightforward for most purposes is as a Pytorch `Tensor`. In this cell, we build the tensor manually for our configuration. In general one would have a script generate the configuration, or an optimizer/sampler would randomly choose parameter values.\n",

    "In order, here is an explanation of the parameters. `z_s` is the redshift of the source. `z_l` is the lens redshift which tells the lens how far away it is from the observer (us). The next two parameters `x0` and `y0` indicate where the lens is relative to the main optical axis, which is the coordinates `(0, 0)`. The `q` parameter gives the axis ratio for the `SIE`, so it knows how elongated it is. Then `phi` indicates the position angle (where the ellipse is pointing). `b` gives the Einstein radius (in arcsec) of the lens. The next `x0` and `y0` provide the position relative to the main optical axis of the Sersic source, here we offset the source slightly to make for an interesting figure. The `q` parameter defines the axis ratio of the Sersic ellipse. `phi` defines the position angle of the ellipse. `n` is the Sersic index which determines how concentrated the light is; `n=0.5` is a Gaussian distribution, `n=1` is an exponential, `n=4` is a De Vaucouleurs profile. `Re` is the radius (in arcsec) within which half the total light of the profile is enclosed. `Ie` is the brightness at `Re`. The next set of parameters are also Sersic parameters, but this time they are for the lens light model."

    "- `Playground`: here we demo the main visualizations of a lensing system (deflection angles, convergence, potential, time delay, magnification) in an interactive display so you can change the parameters by hand and see how the visuals change!\n",
    "- `VisualizeCaustics`: here you can see how to find and display caustics, a must when using `caustics`!\n",
    "- `Simulators`: here we describe the powerful simulator framework and how it can be used to quickly swap models, parameters, and other features and turn a complex forward model into a simple function.\n",
    "- `InvertLensEquation`: here we demo forward ray tracing in `caustic` the process of mapping from the source plane to the image plane."
