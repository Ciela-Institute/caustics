    "Here we will demo the very basics of lensing with a classic `SIE` lens model. We will see what it takes to make an `SIE` model, lens a background `Sersic` source, and sample the resulting image using a `Simulator`. Caustics simulators can generalize to very complex scenarios, here we will use a built-in simulator which handles a common use case (lensing a background source). To start, we of course need to import some modules. FOr the minimal example, this is just `matplotlib` a common package used for plotting, and `caustics` the reason you are here."

    "\n",
    "In order for gravitational lensing to occur, we need some mass to bend the light. Here we define a basic Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid (SIE), which is a versatile profile used in many strong gravitational lensing simulations. As the first argument, we pass the cosmology so that the `SIE` can compute various quantities which make use of the next parameter `z_l`. The lens redshift `z_l` tells the lens how far away it is from the observer (us). The next two parameters `x0` and `y0` indicate where the lens is relative to the main optical axis, which is the coordinates `(0, 0)`. The `q` parameter gives the axis ratio for the `SIE`, so it knows how elongated it is. Then `phi` indicates the position angle (where the ellipse is pointing). FInally, `b` gives the Einstein radius (in arcsec) of the lens."

    "If we wish to see anything in our lensing configuration then we need a bright object in the background to produce some light that will pass through (and be bent by) our lens mass distribution. Here we create a `Sersic` light model which is a common versatile profile for representing galaxies. Note that we don't need to pass a light model any `Cosmology` information, since light models essentially just define a function on `(x,y)` coordinates that gives a brightness, the lens models handle all cosmology related calculations. The first two parameters are `x0` and `y0` which provide the position relative to the main optical axis, here we offset the source slightly to make for an interesting figure. The `q` parameter defines the axis ratio of the Sersic ellipse. `phi` defines the position angle of the ellipse. `n` is the Sersic index which determines how concentrated the light is; `n=0.5` is a Gaussian distribution, `n=1` is an exponential, `n=4` is a De Vaucouleurs profile. `Re` is the radius (in arcsec) within which half the total light of the profile is enclosed. `Ie` is the brightness at `Re`.

First, we pass the `lens` model and the `source` model defined above. Next we use `pixelscale` and `pixels_x` to define the grid of pixels that will be sampled. Finally, we pass the `z_s` redshift at which the source (`Sersic`) model should be placed; recall that light models don't use the cosmology model and so aren't aware of their placement in space."

You will learn much more about what this means in the `Simulators` tutorial notebook, but let's cover the basics here. First, note that this is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), this is how all simulator parameters are represented in Caustics. At the top of the graph is the `Lens_Source` object, you can see in brackets it has a name `sim` which is used as the identifier for it's node in the graph. At the next level is the `z_s` parameter for the redshift of the source (recall, we passed `z_s` when constructing the simulator). Next are the `SIE` and `Sersic` objects which themselves each hold parameters. You will notice that all the parameters are in grey boxes right now, this is because we have set a value for every parameter, they will be white if the parameter is left free (i.e. for sampling)."
