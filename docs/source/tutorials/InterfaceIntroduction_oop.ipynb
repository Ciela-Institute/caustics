    "Here we will demo the very basics of lensing with a classic `SIE` lens model. We will see what it takes to make an `SIE` model, lens a background `Sersic` source, and sample the resulting image using a `Simulator`. Caustics simulators can generalize to very complex scenarios, here we will use a built-in simulator which handles a common use case (lensing a background source). To start, we of course need to import some modules. For the minimal example, this is just `matplotlib` a common package used for plotting, `torch` which is a numerical package for GPU/autodiff (much like `numpy`), and `caustics` the reason you are here.\n",

First, note that this is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), this is how all simulator parameters are represented in Caustics. At the top of the graph is the `LensSource` object, you can see in brackets it has a name `sim` which is used as the identifier for it's node in the graph. At the next level is the `z_s` parameter for the redshift of the source. Next are the `SIE` lens, `Sersic` source, and `Sersic` lenslight objects which themselves each hold parameters. You will notice that all the parameters are in white boxes right now, this is because they are `dynamic` parameters which need values to be passed, grey boxes are used for parameters with fixed values."

In this cell, we build the tensor manually for our configuration. In general one would have a script generate the configuration, or an optimizer/sampler would randomly choose parameter values.\n",
