    "# Modelling a Lens image using MCMC\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hypothetical scenario we have an image of galaxy galaxy strong lensing and we would like to recover a model of this scene. Thus we will need to determine parameters for the background source light, the lensing galaxy light, and the lensing galaxy mass distribution. A common technique for analyzing strong lensing systems is a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo which can explore the parameter space and provide us with important metrics about the model and uncertainty on all parameters. Since caustics is differentiable we have access to especially efficient gradient based MCMC algorithms. First, we will demo a classical MCMC algorithm (using emcee) on the problem and show how for this high dimensional problem the autocorrelation length is high. Next we will show how just adding a bit of gradient information (via MALA) will significantly improve results by reducing autocorrelation length. Finally, we will demo NUTS on the problem, which is highly gradient based and is convenient in that it can be run with no tunable parameters, it's autocorrelation length is generally approximately 1. However, to achieve this, NUTS needs to run many steps internally, which ultimately means that even though it requires more tweaking to set up, MALA, is often more efficient. The best algorithm for your use case will depend on a number of factors, here you will see how caustics can play well with any sampling algorithm available, giving you lots of flexibility!"

    "Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) sampling is the half way point between NUTS and MH, it uses gradient information to make an efficient proposal distribution for a MH step. We have written a basic implementation below for demo purposes. Essentially, one uses a random perturbation like in MH, except with a bias towards higher likelihood which comes from the gradient. Detailed balance is maintained using a MH step, so we still sample the correct distribution."
