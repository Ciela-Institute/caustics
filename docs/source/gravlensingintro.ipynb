    "### Configuration of a Lens\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get too deep into the weeds, lets set the stage. A photon has arrived in your telescope and you are wondering where it came from. Well if it encountered some mass on its path to you (and really what photon hasn't?) then the path it took might look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Lens configuration](assets/lensconfiguration.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Figure taken from Bartelmann and Schneider 2001 (figure 11)*\n",
    "\n",
    "The center of your image is your (0,0) coordinate and this corresponds to the *optical axis* which is the vertical  dashed line. The source of the photon is said to exist in the *source plane* which is a distance of $D_s$ from the observer. The mass that deflected the photon is said to exist in the *lens plane* which is a distance $D_l$ (I use $D_l$ rather that $D_d$ for the sake of my sanity) from the observer and $D_{ls}$ from the source plane. Finally, you receive the photons in the *image plane* at the observer. Note that cosmological distances are so large that these may be very accurately treated as infinitely thin planes, even if the source and the mass are in fact 3D structures. We'll talk a little about extended mass distributions in the [Multiplane Lensing](#multiplane-lensing) section. In the source plane the photons are coming from a point $\\vec{\\eta}$ away from the optical axis, this is a physical distance you could measure in kilometers if you like. In the lens plane, the photon intersected at $\\vec{\\xi}$ away from the optical axis (again physical units). In the image plane we can say the photon was essentially at the optical axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an observer, you measure everything in angular units. The photon is the solid line which you see at some position $\\vec{\\theta}$ off from the optical axis. Had there been no mass intercepting the photon, it would have never reached your telescope, instead a photon coming from the same source would have arrived at $\\vec{\\beta}$ angular units from your optical axis. The correction at the source plane which shows how much the photon deviated from its original path is called the *deflection angle* $\\hat{\\vec{\\alpha}}$ and it is essentially a measure of the impact lensing has had on your observation. Note that in the figure the deflection angle is drawn as if the photon traveled backwards, leaving your telescope at angle $\\vec{\\theta}$ getting to the lens plane, getting deflected by $\\hat{\\vec{\\alpha}}$, and finally arriving at the source plane. This is on purpose since the geometry of lensing works in either direction, but computationally it is easier to go backwards (we'll see why in [the lens equation section](#the-lens-equation)).\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the names and symbols used to describe the configuration of most lensing systems. So far we haven't told you how any of this came to be, but hopefully it will give you a reference point to understand what comes next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Lens Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "With some simple trigonometry it is possible to relate the physical sizes and the angular sizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{\\eta} = \\vec{\\beta} D_s$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{\\xi} = \\vec{\\theta} D_l$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Just note that the distances must be in angular diameter distances for these relations to hold (essentially by definition). We can also go a step further and get $\\vec{\\eta}$ using $\\vec{\\theta}$ and $\\hat{\\vec{\\alpha}}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{\\eta} = \\vec{\\theta} D_s - \\hat{\\vec{\\alpha}} D_{ls}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From here we get the lens equation using the two $\\vec{\\eta}$ formulas:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{\\beta} D_s = \\vec{\\theta} D_s - \\hat{\\vec{\\alpha}} D_{ls}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We are tantalizingly close to just cancelling those $D_s$ distances. How about we make a definition $\\vec{\\alpha} \\equiv \\frac{D_{ls}}{D_s}\\hat{\\vec{\\alpha}}$ then we can write the lens equation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{\\theta} - \\vec{\\alpha}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Excellent! Just note that we had to change $\\hat{\\vec{\\alpha}}$ which is the real angular deflection angle that we can do geometry with, to now be $\\vec{\\alpha}$ which has a convenient refactoring such that the lens equation is easier to work with. The modified $\\vec{\\alpha}$ is called the *reduced deflection angle* and usually other quantities that have had a similar transformation to make the lens equation come out nice are called reduced quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very nice and simple equation, one might be fooled into thinking it is easy to work with. Now lets explain why one typically works backwards with photons \"coming from\" the observer and going to the source plane. The deflection angle for almost all lenses is a function of the position in the sky (more deflection closer to the mass, less deflection further away) meaning that it is in fact a function $\\vec{\\alpha}(\\vec{\\theta})$. So to compute $\\vec{\\beta}$ when you know $\\vec{\\theta}$ means simply computing $\\vec{\\alpha}(\\vec{\\theta})$ and the taking the difference $\\vec{\\theta} - \\vec{\\alpha}(\\vec{\\theta})$. But if you want to compute $\\vec{\\theta}$ only knowing $\\vec{\\beta}$, then you will need to search around for a value to input into $\\vec{\\alpha}(\\vec{\\theta})$ until you can get the equation to be satisfied, which means you need to know $\\vec{\\theta}$ to compute $\\vec{\\theta}$! This is a source of great consternation in gravitational lensing researchers, but is a fact we must deal with. In the next sections we'll get into more specifics on all the interesting results that come from this simple equation."

    "### Lens Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "Lensing is sensitive to all mass on the line of sight. Typically, we describe astronomical massive objects via a 3D density $\\rho(\\vec{\\theta},z)$, but in gravitational lensing we may describe objects as existing on an infinitely thin lens plane.

    "\n",
    "We use $|\\hat{\\vec{\\alpha}}|$ and $|\\vec{\\theta}|$ because angular positions on the sky are 2D vectors, but in this equation we only need to know the magnitudes. A point mass is symmetric about its center with the deflection always pointing inwards. For simplicity we have assumed the point mass is on the optical axis, you can of course translate the point mass to other parts of the field of view. Notice that the deflection drops off with distance from the point mass, it should not be too surprising that the amount of deflection decreases further from the mass.\n",

    "On the cosmic scales of lensing, the finite speed of light becomes especially apparent. This means that when lensing causes multiple images of the same object to appear, they often actually represent the object at different times. There are in fact two reasons for this. One is that the light rays will have taken different paths to reach us the observer, and those different paths are different lengths. Since light travels at a finite speed, a longer path will have taken longer to get to us. The second reason is that gravitational fields bend spacetime and so a certain time delay is induced simply by being in a strong gravitational potential. It turns out that both these effects are often of a similar magnitude and so we need to account for them both. Luckily it is fairly straightforward to do so.\n",

    "The Universe has more than one mass in it, in fact the Universe has many masses in it. A typical gravitational lensing system may be dominated by a single large mass, but it is very common for there so be many *line of sight halos* along the path which perturb a light ray. In some cases there may even be multiple objects of similar mass along the line of sight which each induce their own strong lensing effect. In all of these situations, the simplifying assumptions we made for the above analysis become invalid and we need to be a bit more careful about how we treat the lensing, this is called *multiplane lensing*. Even including many lenses, it is very accurate to consider each mass as individually existing on a thin lensing plane, but now we will have many such planes. Here is a schematic of a general light ray path through a multiplane lensing system.\n",

    "In this figure, the observer is on the left, and the $D_{i}$ are transverse comoving distances to each plane, $D_{i,j}$ is the transverse comovong distance between planes $i$ and $j$, The $\\vec{X}_{i}$ are the comoving coordinates of where the ray strikes each plane, the $\\vec{\\alpha}_{i}$ are the physical deflection angles at each plane. $\\vec{\\theta}_i$ will be the current angle of the ray at each plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform raytracing in this scenario we will again start with the ray spreading out from a single point at the observer. Thus the ray will all have comoving coordinates $\\vec{X}_0 = 0$ (starting from a point), and a starting angle of $\\vec{\\theta}_0$. Since the ray may take a circuitous path through all the planes, we need to keep track of both the $\\vec{X}_i$ at each plane and the $\\vec{\\theta}_i$ as it updates at each plane. Note that we use comoving coordinates so we don't have to account for the expansion of the Universe as a function of redshift. This is unlike the single plane case where we could use angular diameter distances since only one lensing and one source plane were involved and the terms could cancel out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equivalent of the lens equation for multiplane lensing is very similar:\n",

    "\n",
    "where a subscript $s$ indicates the source plane quantity, and $\\mathcal{D}$ is an angular diameter distance. The challenge with this equation is that $\\vec{\\theta}_i$ is an argument of the deflection angle, making the expression cumbersome to evaluate. We now make the transition to comoving distances $D_i = (1+z_i)\\mathcal{D}_i$ and work in comoving coordinates. We can write an expression for the comoving coordinates of the next plane using only the planes before it like so:\n",

    "\n",
    "where we see the first equation essentially breaks down the sum of the angles at each plane (only computing them as we need them, as we figure out the path one plane at a time), the second equation gives the recursion relation but with the angles already accumulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the indexing for $\\vec{X}_i$ and $\\vec{\\theta}_i$ is slightly different. It is best for $\\vec{X}_i$ to think of each plane (including the image plane and source plane) as being the index for $i$, so $i=0$ is the image plane, $i=1$ is the first lens plane, until $i=s$ is the source plane. For $\\vec{\\theta}_i$ it is best to think of is as indexing between planes. So for $\\vec{\\theta}_i$ the $i=0$ index is for angles between the image plane and the first lens plane, $i=1$ would be between the first lens plane and the second, and so on. This means that the indexing for $\\vec{X}_i$ ultimately goes one higher than for $\\vec{\\theta}_i$."

    "As we said earlier, multiplane lenses break a lot of the conventions set out for single plane lenses. However, it is still helpful for some of these quantities to compute effective versions which have similar qualitative behavior. For example, the lens equation is a very convenient construct for computing various quantities. With $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{\\theta} - \\vec{\\alpha}(\\vec{\\theta})$ the $\\vec{\\beta}$ term describes the angular position of where the ray strikes the source plane and $\\vec{\\theta}$ describes the angular position in the image plane, while $\\vec{\\alpha}(\\vec{\\theta})$ can be considered as the accumulation of the deflection after a ray has been traced through the multiplane lensing system. This is an effective reduced deflection angle since it actually just hides a more complex recursive deflection angle calculation. Now that we have a lens equation, we can also compute a jacobian of the lens equation and compute quantities from that. For example, the convergence in a single plane lens is the surface mass density divided by the critical surface density, the catch for multiplane is that the critical surface density is defined relative to a single lensing plane. In multiplane lensing there is no single plane that we can use to normalize the surface mass density, and even the surface mass density itself is spread over cosmological distances! There is, however, a way to compute an effective convergence for a multiplane lensing system. Recall that we can relate the convergence to the isotropic component of $A$ thus we can say:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\kappa_{eff, div} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\alpha_1}{\\partial\\theta_1} + \\frac{\\partial\\alpha_2}{\\partial\\theta_2}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in single plane lensing recall that $A_{12} = A_{21}$, which is connected to the fact that the deflection angles are curl free, and only have divergence. In multiplane lensing, this is no longer the case. This means that we can't just replace all the complicated multiplane lensing with a single plane using $\\kappa_{eff,div}$ (though that is sometimes a nice approximation). There is now a curl based effective convergence as well: \n",
    "\n",
