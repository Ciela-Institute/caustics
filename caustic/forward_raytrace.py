    Implements a forward ray tracing algorithm for a strong gravitational lensing system.

    Args:
        beta_x (Tensor): The x coordinates of the source positions in the source plane.
        beta_y (Tensor): The y coordinates of the source positions in the source plane.
        get_beta_hat (Callable[[Tensor, Tensor], Tuple[Tensor, Tensor]]): A function that returns
            the predicted source positions given the lensed image positions.
        n_images (int): The number of images to produce.
        thetax_range (Tuple[float, float]): The range of x coordinates in the lens plane to consider for initial guesses.
        thetay_range (Tuple[float, float]): The range of y coordinates in the lens plane to consider for initial guesses.
        n_guesses (int, optional): The number of initial guesses for the lensed image positions. Default is 15.
        LM_damping (float, optional): The damping parameter for the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization. Default is 1e-2.
        max_iters_guesses (int, optional): The maximum number of iterations for the optimization of initial guesses. Default is 50.
        max_iters_final (int, optional): The maximum number of iterations for the final optimization. Default is 50.

    Returns:
        Tensor: The optimized lensed image positions in the lens plane.

    This function first generates a set of initial guesses for the lensed image positions.
    These guesses are then optimized using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to match the
    observed source positions. If the optimization fails for any of the initial guesses,
    new guesses are generated and the process is repeated until a successful optimization is achieved.

    Once the initial optimization is complete, the results are pared down to the desired number
    of images using a clustering algorithm, and a final round of optimization is performed.
    The function returns the final optimized lensed image positions.

    Note: If the number of images is greater than the number of observed source positions,
    the function may not be able to find a solution.
